A widgets library built on mootools

Moodgets is a javascript library developed on top of mootools.
The main widget is an editable grid easy to integrate in any website.

The thing I prefer about Moodgets is its plugin philosophy.
The basic features for each widget have been realized in a single .js file. That features can be extended using plugins.
In this way the creation of new features is simplified; the developer doesn't need to deal with the code of features not used.

IMPORTANT:
I released Moodgets years ago under MIT license. At the moment it is not upgraded to the latest mootols versions. 
Anybody who wants to improve it is welcome!
